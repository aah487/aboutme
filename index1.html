	My name is Albert Anthony Herrera. I was born in the great state of NEW YORK. My parents migrated from the beautiful island of The Dominican Republic way before I was born. I am the youngest of two older brothers.Raising three boys in the Lower East Side was no small task for my parents during the 1980's and 1990's. Both of my parents had full time jobs, starting early in the morning and coming home very late. For the most parts we were always alone, at neighbors homes or out in the streets hanging out with the boys. LES in those times was full of crimes and drugs (Certainly not like the Lower East Side everyone knows know).

	Fortunetly for us, my parents enrolled each of us into a private school called Nativity Mission Center at age 9 (if I remember right). Nativity played an important role in the growing up of me and my two older brothers. Most of our days was spent at Nativity. After classes you had the option of staying at Nativity doing your homework and studying or your parents allowed you to go home. For us, we would just there doing homework and playing games, which was great. During the summer they would have mandatory summer camps for 7 weeks in the Adirondack, if you wanted to get back into the school. The idea was to keep us busy during the summer, instead of hanging out in the street during the summer and posibly getting into trouble. After graduating from Nativity, I was accepted into Saint Agnes High School. After Saint Agnes High School, I was accepted into SUNY New Paltz, where I graduate with my Bachelors of Science in General Business.

	Once I graduated from college my life had change DRAMATICALLY. On the day of my first paycheck, I found out that I, Albert Herrera, who was planning to travel around the world, who wanted to live here and there and everywhere ... was having a son.

On April 19, 2011, I became a Dad. Coming home to him everyday is much better then anything I had dreamed of doing..Sure sleep has never been the same since he was born, I probably won't ever get the window seat ever on a plane, my stuff are always missing and most of all, its like hanging out with little monster who just catches tantrums every minute. In the end I wouldnt have it any other way.
<br><br> 
I currently work for a television production company as a operations coordinator. I've been there for 4 years and it's been tough and fun at the same time. For the most part work consumes most of my life. I travel alot to different states for different events. I once drove a satellite truck cross country and was able to take my time and enjoy some views (all payed for). On my own time, I like to workout, I enjoy going out to muesums with the little monster and between my work and my real job, I still find time to hang out with friends, familiy and most of all my lady.
